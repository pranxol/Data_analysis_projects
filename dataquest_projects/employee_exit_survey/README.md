# An Investigation on Employee Exit Surveys

`Department of Education, Training and Employment` **(DETE)** and the `Technical and Further Education` **(TAFE)** institute in Queensland, Australia wants to know whether - 
1. Employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time were resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction. Also, what about experienced, established and veteran employees, who have been there longer?
2. Younger employees were resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction. Also, what about older employees?

Both the institutes made their own exit-surve data available to me. The datasets are available in public domain also, I have provided the link below- <br>

In this projects I have analyzed the datasets by cleaning, combining and visualizing to answer the above questions.
